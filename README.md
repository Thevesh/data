# data
Data which, to the best of my knowledge, I am the first / only to collate and make freely available in a machine-readable format. I will delete files for which I discover a better previous source.

**1) Attendance of MPs for Malaysian Parliament Sittings (House of Commons / Dewan Rakyat)**
100% credit to the Malaysian Parliament (go to parlimen.gov.my) for transparency on MP attendance - I simply scraped the PDFs and put the data together. 

**2) Election results for GE12-14**
100% credit to the Malaysian Election Commission (go to spr.gov.my) for making this data available - again, I simply collated it. For now, I will not make the code for collating the data available, to avoid anyone mis-using it during peak election season.
