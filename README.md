# data
Data which, to the best of my knowledge, I am the first / only to collate and make freely available in a machine-readable format. I will delete files for which I discover a better previous source.

**1) Attendance of MPs for Malaysian Parliament Sittings (House of Commons / Dewan Rakyat)**
100% credit to the Malaysian Parliament (go to parlimen.gov.my) for transparency on MP attendance - I simply scraped the PDFs and put the data together.
